                        Here you'll be able to play on a <u>private</u> <b>world of warcraft :: wrath of the lich king</b> server. This is also for <u>educational</u> purpose and a personal project i've been trying to <u>accomplish</u> by mixing my knowledges. So yeah if you wanna play on my private world of warcraft server, you gunna need to register an account, <a href="./register.php">here</a>.
                        </BR>
                        </BR>
                        Already got an account, you can log in <a href="./login.php">here</a> and edit your account informations for your gaming account.  Thus, i got some rules people need to apply each one of em and since this project gunna leads to a bigger community people got also the duty to make people applies these rules... I'm not a cop and i dont ask anyone to play cop (tho ain't a thief either) and having your ip logged or your email doesnt mean you cannot go against my rules without having sanctions or even be completly banned, i respect private life and won't use any infos anywhere except for my private server project.  Also since i'm using one of my personal email, to be able to reach this project administrator, which is me, i'm also asking to not use my email address anywhere without my permission, or even flood my email box with junk or repeated messages...
                        </BR>
                        </BR>
                        Also since this project is building up everyday, i gunna need to recruit people as game master(GM).  To be able to obtain the game master(GM) rank you'll have to <a href="./gm_application.php">fill an application</a> and tell me why i should make <u>you</u>, a game master(GM).
                        </BR>
                        </BR>
                        Thus hope you'll have fun on killigon - wotlk private server and see you in game soon!!!
